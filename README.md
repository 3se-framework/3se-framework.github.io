> A modern, agile-inspired engineering framework for socio-cyber-physical systems — bridging disciplines, aligning stakeholders, and empowering engineers.

## What is 3SE?

3SE is an engineering framework that unifies System Engineering, Safety Engineering, and Security Engineering under a single, coherent language and methodology. 

Built on the values of the Agile Manifesto and designed for the complexity of modern socio-cyber-physical systems — including organizations themselves — 3SE provides the ontology, processes, and methodologies to engineer with clarity, consistency, and confidence.

Whether you are designing a critical infrastructure system, a connected product, or an organizational architecture, 3SE gives your teams a shared foundation to reason, communicate, and deliver together.

## Why 3SE?

Engineering systems today means navigating a maze of siloed disciplines and fragmented standards. 

The result? Projects that drift, risks that slip through the cracks, and engineers constrained by processes that were never designed for them.

3SE was born from a simple observation: **the problems are systemic, and the solutions must be too.**

## The Pains 3SE Solves

### Siloed disciplines
Systems, safety, and security engineers work in parallel worlds — different teams, different vocabularies, different tools. 
Critical dependencies are missed. 
Integration happens too late, if at all.

### Fragmented standards, no shared semantics
ISO 15288, IEC 61508, IEC 62443, DO-178C… each standard speaks its own language. 
Without semantic alignment, compliance becomes a translation exercise rather than a quality driver.

### Misalignment across management layers
Business management, project management, engineering management, and quality management each pull in different directions. 
Without a shared model, decisions are made in isolation and trade-offs are invisible.

### Engineers micromanaged instead of empowered
Traditional frameworks prescribe how to work rather than what to achieve.
3SE puts responsibility and flexibility back in the hands of engineers, trusting them to navigate complexity with the right tools and principles.

## The 3SE Tetrahedron

At the heart of 3SE lies the **3SE Tetrahedron** — a conceptual model that structures the engineering problem space into four interconnected domains:

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Business** | Business Management defines what is worth building from a commercial perspective, balancing investment against expected return across the full lifecycle. |
| **Engineering** | Engineering Management is the translation layer between commercial intent and physical reality. It owns technical feasibility and capability.  |
| **Asset** | Asset Management takes care about physical and digital assets, their properties and lifecycle. It owns the organizational infrastructure that ensures consistent, repeatable, and compliant output. |
| **Project** | Project Management orchestrates the sequence of work, manages dependencies, and ensures that the deliverables reach the stakeholders within the agreed timeframe. |

These **four domains** are linked by **six trade-offs** — the axes of tension that every engineering team must navigate — all converging toward a single **feasible design space**: the solution that is technically sound, safe, secure, and viable.

The tetrahedron is not a process. It is a thinking tool — a map for reasoning about complexity before committing to solutions.

## What 3SE contains

3SE is a complete engineering framework, not just a methodology.
It provides:

### An Ontology
A formal, shared vocabulary that aligns concepts across systems, safety, and security engineering. 
No more translation. 
No more ambiguity. 
One language for all disciplines.

### Process Descriptions
Clearly defined engineering and support processes, each with associated roles, workflows, and templates. 
Designed to be lean, adaptable, and actionable in agile contexts.

### An Engineering Language
A structured language for expressing engineering artefacts consistently — from requirements to hazard analyses, from threat models to architecture decisions.

### JARVIS4SE — The Engineering Tool
3SE's language is brought to life in **JARVIS4SE**, an open engineering tool that operationalises the framework.
